# Helbreath Apocalypse - Website

This folder (`docs/`) is set up for GitHub Pages. To publish:

1. Push `docs/` to your `main` branch (already in this repo).
2. In the GitHub repository settings > Pages, choose `main` branch and `/docs` folder as source.
3. The site will be available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Replace `assets/img/logo.png` with your final logo if needed.
